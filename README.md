# Backend-of-blog-app
 Developed a blog app featuring a user-friendly front end showcasing admin-written blogs. Utilized a secure login/signup system with web tokens. The admin panel grants access to a limited section, allowing designated users to add, edit, and delete blogs. The open section enables anyone to read blogs without requiring membership. Employed React and Express for frontend and backend, respectively, and MongoDB for efficient data storage. This project showcases proficiency in authentication, access control, and dynamic content creation.
